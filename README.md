# Belief Revision Engine

## Introduction
Belief revision is a pivotal topic in theoretical computer science, logic, and artificial intelligence. It provides mechanisms to modify information repositories when new knowledge emerges, ensuring the integrity of the knowledge base remains intact. This project delves into the AGM belief revision approach, emphasizing the challenges and intricacies of updating beliefs in a database, especially when they have logical consequences.

## Overview
- **Problem Statement**: When an intelligent agent encounters new information that contradicts existing beliefs, determining which beliefs to revise becomes a challenge. The logical implications of these beliefs further complicate the revision process.
- **Objective**: Design and implement a belief revision engine that can output a revised belief based on a given propositional formula input.
- **Approaches**: The project focuses on the AGM belief revision approach, which encompasses three forms of belief change: expansion, contraction, and revision.
